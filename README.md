A Dark & Light Mode Project.

## Getting Started

A Dark & Light Mode Flutter Project is a Flutter project that allows users to switch between a dark and light theme. This can be useful for users who prefer to use a dark theme at night or in low-light conditions, or for users who simply want to change the look of their app.
